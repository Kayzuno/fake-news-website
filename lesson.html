<p>The influence of social media and the sheer reach of information 
both true and false —is dominating headlines and the collective public conscience. 
Most recently, false stories surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election spread like wildfire, causing many to question the power of social platforms such as Facebook,
when it comes to the spread of bogus news. While we can’t control the click-crazy groups sharing half-truths online.Another warning appears if users try to share the story, although Facebook doesn't prevent such sharing or delete the fake news story. The "fake" tag will however negatively impact the story's score in Facebook's algorithm, meaning that fewer people will see it pop up in their news feeds.

<h1>3 ways to spot and stop fake news</h1>
<li>Before sharing a piece of content double, even triple check the article’s source. Google the headline (or subject) to see if the story appears in other reliable publications. If it’s isolated “breaking news,” and it coming from a sketchy source outside of the mainstream media, then it’s (likely) not breaking news. People creating fake news are getting more sophisticated creating stories that look, sound, and incite.</li>
<li>Be especially diligent in checking sources during times of national tension when tempers are running high. Often false stories are planted to by special interest groups to fuel one side or the other of a social crisis. Teach kids to think carefully before sharing such information. When in doubt — don’t share, post, or publish.</li>
<li>Look for sensational stories that mix real news articles in with completely made-up stories in an attempt to appear credible. Also look for outrageous ads on the page. Reliable news outlets will not have weight loss pills or celebrity gossip blog posts flanking legitimate news coverage.</li>

<p> There is alot of news surrounding the vaccine lately that it is hard to distinguish wether it is fake or not.
Today we will give you some insite on the fake vaccine news.
From claims the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue<em>(it doesn’t)</em>, to assertions it attacks genes in the body necessary for it to function <em>(this is not true)</em> and that people in vaccine studies already have immunity <em>(they don’t)</em>, social media is flooded with scientific-sounding <em>“nonsense”</em>.
Other inaccurate claims include the commonly-shared theory that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips and that it is experimental because it has been produced in record-time.
This means inaccurate information could stop us from reaching herd immunity and cost countless lives.
Many of these arguments are easily believed as they use scientific language or are shared by people who claim to have a background in science – but epidemiologists, vaccine experts and Covid-19 experts told i they are completely wrong and go against the facts.
